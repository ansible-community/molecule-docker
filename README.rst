Molecule Docker Plugin is designed to allow use docker containers for
provisioning test resources.

Please note that this driver is currently in its early stage of development.

This plugin will function only if you also install `community.docker` ansible
collection. Keep in mind that this requires newer version of docker python
module which may not come with system-packaged versions of ansible like
Ubuntu ones.

Please do not file bugs towards molecule or this plugin if Ansible fails to
execute any docker modules (missing or incorrect versions of docker or requests
python modules). Instead file them on [community.docker](https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker)
